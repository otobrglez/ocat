# Playing with Objective-C

This are my experiments with Objective-C.

- [Oto Brglez](https://github.com/otobrglez)

## Examples

- [Day 01](src/01) - Simple Objective-C app with loops.
- [Day 02](src/02) - Interface, implementation, and simple class.
- [Day 03](src/03) - Pointers and more classes.

## Building examples

Code for can be build from command line.

```
make            # build all examples

make day-01     # build just one
./day-01

make clean      # clean everything
```
