# Playing with Objective-C

This are my experiments with Objective-C.

- [Oto Brglez](https://github.com/otobrglez)

## Examples

- [Day 01](src/01) - Simple Objective-C app with loops.
- [Day 02](src/02) - Interface, implementation, and simple class.
- [Day 03](src/03) - Pointers and some classes.
- [Day 04](src/04) - Classes, setters, getters, properties, categories and [LLDB](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/gdb_to_lldb_transition_guide/document/lldb-command-examples.html).
- [Day 05](src/05) - [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) & XCode and [xcodebuild](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/xcodebuild.1.html).

## Building examples

Code for can be build from command line.

```
make            # build all examples

make day-01     # build just one
./day-01

make clean      # clean everything
```
