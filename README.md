# Playing with Objective-C

This are my experiments with Objective-C.

- [Oto Brglez](https://github.com/otobrglez)

## Examples

- [Day 01](src/01) - Simple Objective-C app with loops.
- [Day 02](src/02) - Interface, implementation, and simple class.

## Building examples

Code for day can be build from command line with gcc pre-installed.

    ```
    make day-01
    ./day-01
    ```
